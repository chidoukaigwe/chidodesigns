                                    The Book Learn Pass (BLP) project is a custom wordpress build, which utilizes the Woocommerce plugin, to process transactions. I wrote code that would hook into the Woocommerce plugin, to develop and customize woocommerce page templates and I wrote custom functions to help deliver a more in-tune website experience for BLP's business goals. I used the popular Advanced Custom Fields plugin, to develop functionality on the backend and frontend of BLP. This functionality would enable content creators to create dynamic data on the fly.

                                <p class="mg-btm-2">
                                    The websites main goal is to rank well for its targeted search terms so optimizing and the continuous maintenance of an optimized website is of high priority. Baked into BLP is industry standard SEO practices using plugins like (Yoast SEO) to fine tune the website for search engines. The focus of my optimization techniques is page speed, and how fast can we deliver a page whether on Desktop or Mobile, plays a critical role in ranking positions with search engines. Taking a deeper dive into Wordpress site optimization forces you as a developer to look at your development architecture and codebase, further fine-tuning your development approach and site architecture.
