                I have worked as a full time onsite web developer, as a contractor and as a freelancer taking on various projects of all sizes, that span different areas of the web. <br><br>
                I sought after these challenges to become a more wholistic web developer that could bring a unique edge case to every project I would work on and I intend to pursue this approach pattern as a full stack web developer.
