                <p>
                    Any project I undertake starts off with one question:<br><br>
                    <strong>What are we trying to achieve?</strong><br><br>
                    Engaging in a collaborative discussion towards answering this question, brings us closer to achieving the project's objectives.<br><br>Anticipating challenges  ahead of time and bringing them to the forefront of the project as early as possible, leads to more intelligently executed solutions .<br><br>
                    How I work is simple. I work to understand problems. I work to provide solutions to 'said' problems.
                </p>
