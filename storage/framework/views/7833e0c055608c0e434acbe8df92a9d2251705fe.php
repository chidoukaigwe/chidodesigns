                    I am a highly motivated, self-starting full stack web developer. With a strong focus on Object Oriented Web App Development using PHP Frameworks such as Slim & Laravel, and working with pure PHP. I have strong commercial experience with PHP CMS's (Wordpress & Drupal; which extend to site building and custom theme development.                           
                </p>

                <p class="mg-btm-2">
                    As a Full Stack PHP Developer, my focus is on building database driven web applications. Built around the MVC (Model - View - Controller) design pattern and with an inherent focus on Object Oriented design.

                    I have a keen interest in setting up and understanding development workflow patterns - Creating a workflow that embodies: <br><br> 
                    <strong>Local Development <small>(A developer's sandbox).</small></strong><br>
                    <strong>Staging Development</strong> <small>(which encompasses various stakeholders at this point).</small><br>
                    <strong>Production Environment</strong> <small>(A combination of the work that happens at Local and Staging)</small>.
                    <br><br>

                    This development workflow patterns are often glued together by some sort of <strong>Version Control System</strong>, I use <strong>GIT</strong> coupled with a continous development workflow practice, that leads to smooth, automated deployment processes (Gitlab or DeployHQ).
