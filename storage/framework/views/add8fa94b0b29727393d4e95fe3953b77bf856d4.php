                <p class="mg-btm-4">
                    This application is built based on CRUD operation principles; combining HTML5 and CSS3 on the front-end, along with PHP and MySQL on the backend. This application is framework free, with the focus on hand coding the web app from the from start to finish, from front-end to back-end.
                    <br><br>
                    I only used two libraries within this web application: Google Fonts and Font Awesome - I also used Pexels, a photo sharing website for free stock images.
