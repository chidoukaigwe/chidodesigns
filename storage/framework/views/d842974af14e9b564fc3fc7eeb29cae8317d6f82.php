                    I am a highly motivated, self-starting full stack web developer with a strong focus on test driven development, coupled with object-oriented application programming, following MVC design patterns.
                </p>

                <p>
                    PHP is the core programming language I use to build web applications, utilising frameworks such as Laravel and Symfony for code architecture, application development and efficiency in my code. I have extensive commercial experience with popular PHP based content management systems, Wordpress and Drupal; with experience ranging from templated websites to bespoke theme/plugin development.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Javascript is my secondary language, building backend applications with the Node.js (for server side programming), utilising frameworks such as Express.js to help speed up development; whilst using frontend javascript frameworks like Vue.js and Angular.js for consumer facing interfaces.
                </p>
