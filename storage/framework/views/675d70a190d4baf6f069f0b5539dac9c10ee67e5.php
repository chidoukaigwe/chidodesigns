                <p>
                    Any project I undertake starts off with one question:<br><br>
                    <strong>What are we trying to achieve?</strong><br><br>
                    Engaging in a collaborative discussion towards answering this question, brings us closer to achieving the business goals.<br><br>Constructive and positive discussions provides us with better insight into the business needs and the project we are undertaking.<br><br>
                    How I work is simple. I work to understand problems. <br><br>I work to provide solutions to 'said' problems.

                <p class="mg-btm-3">
                    My skills extend beyond just web development. I take my technical skills and look to implement them into the business needs of a project.<br><br> Combining the technical mindset and understanding of what is achievable and marrying that up with the business projects goals and expected ROI. <br><br>As a web developer I go beyond the technical outlook of a project, integrating what the business wants, how it promotes itself, the business brand and its message.<br><br>What I can do, is build or strengthen a digital asset for a business with an online prescence.<br>
