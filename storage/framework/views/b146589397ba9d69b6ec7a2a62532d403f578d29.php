                                    Book Learn Pass is on a mission to make it easier for learner drivers to make informed decisions about who they learn to drive with, while at the same time, saving money on their driving lessons.

                                    Book Learn Pass is a startup with the goal of bringing together learner drivers and driving instructors, and enabling individuals looking for a driving instructor in their local area to find one.

                                    This web design project was driven by content strategy: with the main goal to load fast paced web pages. We wanted to be able to deliver content pages (2,000 word+) that had transactional elements (woocommerce products) to mobile and desktop views, in an optimised manner.

                                    With this in mind, prototyping a quick skeleton theme for Book Learn Pass V1 was of high priority.

The initial version of Book Learn Pass was to bring together a website that could create dynamic content from the backend, process transactions on the site, and deliver fast pace content. These objectives have been achieved!</p>
