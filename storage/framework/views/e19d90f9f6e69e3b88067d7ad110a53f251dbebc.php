                    <p class="mg-btm-4"> The build was focused on the creative needs of the company; factoring in what they would like to be able to do and create from a content management perspective and how it would be delivered and displayed, from an aesthetic point of view. </p>
                    <p class="mg-btm-4"> Developing a lightweight, responsive API that could communicate easily between our back and frontend applications, was paramount to the modern web design the client sought for.</p>
                    <p class="mg-btm-4">Once the communication layer was in place, we would task ourselves with creating flexible routes to collect, process and deliver data, enabling the future application to take on new features quickly and scale.</p>

                        I worked as the lead backend developer on this build. Developing a bespoke object oriented Wordpress web application, with ecommerce and multisite capabilities.

                    <p class="mg-btm-4">
                        I built a hybrid Wordpress application, that combined the Wordpress native capabilities with its RESTful API features. Meaning that sections of the Company Of Animals application, interchange between API calls and custom Wordpress functionality.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mg-btm-4">
                        I took the most important client feature requests and mapped scalable solutions that would enable flexible codebase growth and functionality.

                    <p class="mg-btm-2">
                        I took the pain points of the client's (old website and cms) and compared it with the product specification the agency was expected to deliver.
                    </p>

                    <p class="mg-btm-2">
                        I analysed the gap between the two positions and began to build a backend product that bridged the old way of working with the new way of working and seeing their digital asset.
                    </p>

                    <p class="mg-btm-2">
                        Developing a flexible, scalable, responsive application was at the forefront of my mind. Understanding the various stakeholders and their would be jobs within the admin area, was important to how I shaped the codebase and approached every single detail that the client would interact with *naming convention of fields included.
